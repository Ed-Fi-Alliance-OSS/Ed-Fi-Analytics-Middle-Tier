# Ed-Fi-Analytics-Middle-Tier

The Analytics Middle Tier is a set of denormalized analytics views over the Ed-Fi ODS database tables, satisfying the user story:
> As a district data analyst, I want to build intelligent reporting on the Ed-Fi ODS with minimal learning curve and low risk of breaking changes, so that I can deliver timely data to educators and administrators.

Looking for an easy way to get started? Search for tickets with label
